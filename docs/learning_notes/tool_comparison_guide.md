## 🏗 **Data Processing Libraries**

### Your Current Stack Analysis

#### **Pandas** (Foundation)
```python
# Your comfort zone
+ Familiar syntax
+ Great for learning
+ Excellent documentation
+ Works well up to ~1GB data

# When to use in your project:
- Data exploration and analysis
- Small to medium datasets
- Prototyping transformations
```

#### **Polars** (Modern Choice)
```python
# Why it's in your project:
+ 10-50x faster than Pandas
+ Better memory efficiency
+ Rust-based (very fast)
+ Similar API to Pandas

# When to prefer:
- Larger datasets (>1GB)
- Performance-critical pipelines
- Learning modern data tools

# Example from your benchmark:
df = pl.read_csv("logs.csv")
result = (df
  .filter(pl.col("risk_score") > 70)
  .group_by("event_type")
  .agg(pl.count())
)
```

#### **DuckDB** (SQL Analytics)
```python
# Why it's powerful:
+ SQL interface
+ Extremely fast for analytics
+ Works with Pandas/Polars
+ Perfect for OLAP queries

# Your use case:
import duckdb

# Direct SQL on your data
result = duckdb.sql("""
  SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) 
  FROM 'data/silver/logs/*.json' 
  WHERE risk_score > 70
  GROUP BY event_type
""").df()
```
