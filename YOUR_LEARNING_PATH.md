# 🚀 Your Personalized Data Engineering Learning Path

## 🎯 Perfect Fit for Your Background

Given your **CS background**, **SQL/Python comfort level**, and **hands-on learning preference**, this project is ideally structured for you:

- **Foundation**: Your existing Python/SQL skills
- **Focus**: Apache Airflow (most in-demand DE skill)  
- **Approach**: Practical, hands-on with real code
- **Domain**: Cybersecurity (your interest area)
- **Progression**: Local → Cloud (employment-ready skills)

## 📊 **Storage Strategy: Partitioned Files (Your Question Answered)**

✅ **DEFINITELY go with partitioned files** (daily/hourly) rather than huge monolithic files:

### Why Partitioned is Better for Learning DE:
```bash
# This structure teaches you real-world patterns:
data/
├── bronze/logs/date=2025-01-15/hour=09/security_logs.json
├── bronze/logs/date=2025-01-15/hour=10/security_logs.json
├── silver/validated_logs/date=2025-01-15/cleaned_logs.parquet
└── gold/daily_summaries/date=2025-01-15_summary.json
```

**Real-world Benefits You'll Learn:**
- **Incremental Processing**: Only process new data
- **Error Recovery**: Reprocess only failed partitions  
- **Performance**: Query only relevant time ranges
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple workers on different partitions
- **Cost Optimization**: In cloud, you pay for data scanned

## 🛠 **Your Local Development Setup (Storage Requirements)**

### **Storage Requirements** (Very Reasonable)
```
Daily logs: 50K events × 1KB each = ~50MB/day
Monthly: ~1.5GB (raw + processed + backups)
Annual: ~20GB total (including indexes, analytics)

👍 Easily fits on any modern laptop!
```
